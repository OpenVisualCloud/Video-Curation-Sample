This sample implements libraries of video files content analysis, database ingestion, content search and visualization:   
- **Ingest**: Analyze video content and ingest the data into the VDMS.  
- **VDMS**: Store metadata efficiently in a graph-based database.  
- **Visualization**: Visualize content search based on video metadata.

**This is a concept sample in active development.**   

### Software Stacks

The sample is powered by the following Open Visual Cloud software stacks:      
- **Media Analytics**:   
  - [The GStreamer-based media analytics stack](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Dockerfiles/tree/master/Xeon/ubuntu-16.04/analytics/gst) is used for object, face and emotion detection. The software stack is optimized for [Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Dockerfiles/tree/master/Xeon/ubuntu-16.04/analytics/gst).  
 
- **NGINX Web Service**:
  - [The NGINX/FFmpeg-based web serving stack](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Dockerfiles/tree/master/Xeon/centos-7.6/media/nginx) is used to store and segment video content and serve web services. The software stack is optimized for [Intel Xeon Scalable Processors](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Dockerfiles/tree/master/Xeon/centos-7.6/media/nginx).  

### Install Prerequisites:

- **Time Zone**: Check that the timezone setting of your host machine is correctly configured. Timezone is used during build. If you plan to run the sample on a cluster of machines managed by Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, please make sure to synchronize time among the manager/master node and worker nodes.    

- **Build Tools**: Install ```cmake``` and ```m4``` if they are not available on your system.        

- **Docker Engine**:        
  - Install [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/install).     
  - Install [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install), if you plan to deploy through docker compose. Version 1.20+ is required.    
  - Setup [docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm), if you plan to deploy through docker swarm. See [Docker Swarm Setup](deployment/docker-swarm/README.md) for additional setup details.  
  - Setup [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup), if you plan to deploy through Kubernetes. See [Kubernetes Setup](deployment/kubernetes/README.md) for additional setup details.     
  - Setup docker proxy as follows if you are behind a firewall:   

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d       
printf "[Service]\nEnvironment=\"HTTPS_PROXY=$https_proxy\" \"NO_PROXY=$no_proxy\"\n" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/proxy.conf       
sudo systemctl daemon-reload          
sudo systemctl restart docker     
```

### Build Sample: 

```bash
mkdir build    
cd build     
cmake ..    
make     
```

See also: [Customize Build Process](doc/cmake.md).    

### Start/stop Sample: 

Use the following commands to start/stop services via docker-compose:        

```bash
make start_docker_compose      
make stop_docker_compose      
```

Use the following commands to start/stop services via docker swarm:    

```bash
make update # optional for private registry
make start_docker_swarm      
make stop_docker_swarm      
```

See also:  [Docker Swarm Setup](deployment/docker-swarm/README.md).    

Use the following commands to start/stop Kubernetes services:

```
make update # optional for private registry
make start_kubernetes
make stop_kubernetes
```

See also: [Kubernetes Setup](deployment/kubernetes/README.md).    

### Launch Sample UI:

Launch your browser and browse to ```https://<hostname>```. The sample UI is similar to the following:    

<IMG src="doc/sample-ui.gif" height="270px"></IMG>

---

* For Kubernetes/Docker Swarm, ```<hostname>``` is the hostname of the manager/master node.
* If you see a browser warning of self-signed certificate, please accept it to proceed to the sample UI.
